## üìã **How to Use**

### **Method 1: Access the Prebuilt Website**
Visit the deployed website on [**Netlify**](https://kind-aura.netlify.app/homepage) for a fully functional experience. No setup required!

---

### **Method 2: Build Your Own Instance**

Follow these steps to set up and run kindAura locally:

#### 1. Clone the Repository
Run the following command in your terminal to clone the project:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/kindaura.git
```

#### 2. Navigate to the Project Directory
Run the following command in your terminal to clone the project:
```bash
cd kindaura
```

### 3. Set Up Your Backend with Supabase
kindAura uses Supabase to manage posts and user data. Follow these steps:
#### 1. Replace Supabase Placeholders:
Open the ```assets/js/handlePosts.js``` and replace const ```SUPABASE_URL```'s value with your Supabase Url and const ```SUPABASE_KEY```'s value with your Supabase key.
#### 2. Create the posts Table:
In your supabase project, open SQL Editor and run the following code:
```sql
CREATE TABLE posts (
    id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,     
    username TEXT NOT NULL,     
    content TEXT NOT NULL,       
    imageurl TEXT,                  
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now(),
    likes INT DEFAULT 0               
);

ALTER TABLE posts ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

CREATE POLICY "Allow anonymous inserts"
ON posts
FOR INSERT
TO anon
WITH CHECK (true);

CREATE POLICY "Allow anonymous reads"
ON posts
FOR SELECT
TO anon
USING (true);
```
This code will create the posts table for you and enable RLS

#### 3. Replace Supabase Placeholders:
Open the ```assets/js/loginSignup.js``` and replace const ```supabaseUrl```'s value with your Supabase Url and const ```supabaseKey```'s value with your Supabase key.
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.handle_new_user()
RETURNS trigger AS $$
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO public.profiles (id, username, email, created_at, updated_at)
    VALUES (
        new.id,
        COALESCE(new.raw_user_meta_data->>'username', new.email), -- fallback to email if no username
        new.email,
        now(),
        now()
    );
    RETURN new;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;

DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS on_auth_user_created ON auth.users;
CREATE TRIGGER on_auth_user_created
    AFTER INSERT ON auth.users
    FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION public.handle_new_user();

ALTER TABLE public.pro  files ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

CREATE POLICY "Public profiles are viewable by everyone"
    ON profiles FOR SELECT
    USING (true);

CREATE POLICY "Users can update own profile"
    ON profiles FOR UPDATE
    USING (auth.uid() = id);
```

## üåê **Deploying the Project**
After setting up Supabase:
- Deploy the front-end code using any web hosting platform (e.g., Netlify, Vercel).
- Ensure your Supabase API keys and database settings are configured correctly for live deployment.

---

## üö´ **Privacy Concerns**

- This project uses Supabase, which gives administrators full access to all data stored in the database. This includes:
  - The ability to view all registered email addresses of users.
  - Full control over every post, including the ability to edit usernames, content, images, and other post details.
- We are not liable for any posts created in the website due to inactive moderation of posts.
